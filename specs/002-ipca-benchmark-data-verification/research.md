# Research: IPCA Benchmark, Ticker Plot, and Data Verification

## Research Tasks

1.  **Determine the Python version used in the project.**
2.  **Research and recommend a suitable testing framework for the project.**

## Findings

### 1. Python Version

**Decision**: Assume Python 3.11 for now. The user can correct this if needed.
**Rationale**: It is a recent and stable version of Python.
**Alternatives considered**: Python 3.9, 3.10.

### 2. Testing Framework

**Decision**: Recommend `pytest`.
**Rationale**: `pytest` is a popular, easy-to-use, and powerful testing framework for Python. It has a rich ecosystem of plugins and is well-suited for a project of this scale.
**Alternatives considered**: `unittest` (built-in, but more verbose), `nose2`.
