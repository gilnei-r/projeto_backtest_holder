# Quickstart: Update Benchmark Data

This feature changes the primary benchmark from SELIC to CDI. To run the application with the updated benchmark, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The application will now use the CDI rate as the primary benchmark for all calculations and visualizations.
