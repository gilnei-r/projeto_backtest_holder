# Projeto B&H Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Code must be clean, readable, and maintainable. It should follow established coding standards and best practices. All code should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.

### II. Testing Standards
All new features and bug fixes must be accompanied by comprehensive unit and integration tests. A minimum of 80% test coverage is required for all new code.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface and experience must be consistent across the entire application. All new UI components must adhere to the established design system and style guide.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet defined performance benchmarks. All new code must be profiled and optimized to ensure it does not introduce performance regressions.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for all development practices within this project. Any proposed amendments must be submitted as a pull request, reviewed by the entire team, and receive unanimous approval before being merged.
